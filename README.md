# The Document Object Model

This repository contains various examples demonstrating how to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and use event delegation in JavaScript. It also covers methods such as `setInterval`, form submissions, and event propagation.

This repository is about the Document Object Model (DOM) and practical implementation of its features. The scope of this project is to design one page website and make use of all the capabilities  provided by DOM.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques, HTML and CSS


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS3**

## Objectives

- Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience.
- Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web application.
- Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
- Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

## Instructions

- Create a small single-page web application on the topic and content you want. 
- Follow the  technical requirements listed. 
- Keep things simple. Finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so in order to help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.
- Once you have an idea in mind, approach your design through the user's perspective. User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design. If users enjoy their time on with your application, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and use the application again in the future.

## Requirements

-  The requirements listed here are absolute minimums. Ensure that your application meets these requirements before attempting to further expand your features.
- Create your application locally, and initialize a local git repo. Make frequent commits to the repo. When your application is complete, push your repo to GitHub and submit the link to the GitHub page using the submission instructions at the top of this document.

- Cache at least one element using `selectElementById`.
- Cache at least one element using `querySelector` or `querySelectorAll`.
- Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (`firstChild`, `lastChild`, `parentNode`, `nextElementSibling`, etc.).
- Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.
- Create at least one element using `createElement`.
- Use `appendChild` and/or `prepend` to add new elements to the DOM.
- Use the `DocumentFragment` interface or HTML templating with the `cloneNode` method to create templated content. 
- Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using `innerHTML`, `innerText`, or `textContent`.
- Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the `style` or `classList` properties.
- Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.
- Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.
- Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.
- Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.
- Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)
- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
- Commit frequently to the git repository.
- Include a README file that contains a description of your application.
- Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.


## Reflection (Optional)
- What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
- Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
- What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
- Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
